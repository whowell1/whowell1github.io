At the end of an interview, when a recruiter asks if you have any questions, you should definitely ask several follow-up questions. These are some questions that should be asked to the hiring manager to get a little more insight on the team. IR can be a stressful job so the fewer surprises you have the better. Here is an example of questions to consider asking. 

1. What does success look like in 90 days? How would I be set up for success?

2. What tools do you use at the company to help with IR?
3. How big is your team and who is the longest tenured person on the team? How long have they been there? What are your boss’s career aspirations?
4. What are the on-call expectations?
5. Imagine that there is a major incident. Describe to me what that looks like?
6. What does the training budget look like on a year to year basis?
7. What kind of threats are you worried about and how are you tracking these threats?
8. How many endpoints do you have? What percent of the environment is Windows, Mac, cloud, and Linux?
9. What is the average number of alerts that you get in a day?
10. How does purple teaming look like at the company? How do tabletop exercises look at the company?
11. What does collaboration with the different cyber teams look like? Are there going to be opportunities for shadowing other teams?
12. What percentage of your job is IR work?
13. What does a typical IR analyst's day look like? 
14. Tell me how the greater cyber org is structured. Who is going to be your boss’s boss and how long have they been there?
15. How long has the IR been a part of the company? Does it have external contractors? If it does, how are their roles different?
16. How is the success of the IR team measured at the company?
