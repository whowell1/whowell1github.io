Every year, more and more people ask me how I got into the field of cybersecurity, especially as I meet and talk to more people at conferences. Some of them are students, while others are established professionals looking to transition into cybersecurity. Many students and career changers are attracted to cybersecurity because of the promising earning potential. Here’s a compilation of things I wish someone had told me before I started in this career:

1. The "millions" of open cybersecurity jobs is a myth

One major reason people want to transition into cybersecurity is because of headlines predicting 3.5 million unfilled cybersecurity jobs by 2025. This number is misleading because the industry is still evolving, and there’s no universal definition of what a cybersecurity job entails. I’ve seen job postings where positions like incident response are listed under various titles, such as security analyst, incident response engineer, or incident handler, adding to the confusion.

2. Most people get into cybersecurity by accident, referral, or military experience

Most of the cybersecurity professionals I know who didn’t come from a military background ended up here by chance. Some were engineers who identified security flaws in production systems, others were involved in investigating cybercrime, or they had connections that opened doors for them. Getting a cybersecurity job straight out of college can be tough because universities often do a poor job teaching fundamental cybersecurity concepts.

3. Cybersecurity is more than just pen-testing—find something that interests you

Many people want to become red teamers or hackers because movies and media glamorize hacking. However, red team roles are highly specialized and harder to land due to the niche skills required. Even the few universities with strong cybersecurity programs don’t necessarily provide adequate training for red team jobs.

That said, there are far more opportunities in cyber defense, including roles like incident response, cyber threat intelligence, or governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) analyst. These positions often require less prior experience, and most of the skills can be learned on the job.

4. Computer Science and Cybersecurity are different but related fields

When I was trying to figure out how to get into cybersecurity, I chose to major in computer science because my school didn’t offer a cybersecurity degree. Although I learned algorithms and data structures, I struggled to see how they were relevant to cybersecurity. While programming can be part of cybersecurity, it’s not essential for every role. In fact, during my undergraduate years, I rarely had the chance to apply my programming skills directly to cybersecurity.

That said, knowing how to code can be very useful, as it allows you to create custom tools and scripts that make your work easier. (Ironically, after I graduated, my school, Georgia Tech, introduced a dedicated track in cybersecurity within the computer science program.)

5. Cybersecurity is a cost center for most organizations

Unless you work for a cybersecurity consulting firm, cybersecurity doesn’t generate revenue for most companies. Since it’s hard to measure the success of a cybersecurity team, organizations often cut cybersecurity budgets when profits decline or during economic downturns. In my experience, companies only make significant investments in cybersecurity after experiencing a security breach. Given current trends, the cybersecurity job market is likely to remain competitive in 2025 as well.
