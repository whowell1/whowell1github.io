<!-- My Journey As into cyber security

When I graduated from high school, I had no idea what I wanted to do. I remember telling some teachers that I wanted to double major in biology and African American history. I wanted to major in biology because I thought that would be a easy major, and I wanted to major in African American history because I loved the Civil Rights movements.
Unlike many of my peers, I took a semester off before I started to go to college as I navigated the move back to the States after going high school abroad. 
 During my gap year, the biggest headline in the news was about Edward Snowden and how he was able show the capacaity of the United States government to spy on everyone in the world. I saw 
The more I learned about this topic, the more questions I had. I started to question the devices that I used in my everyday life, and the power it had over me. Not only did I start to question the technology that I used, but I started to question the relationshp that I had with technology and how it leaves an impact on a social, economical, and political scale. However, as a history nerd, I did not have the language or the skills to understand the technical world that I lived in, so I decided to focus my studies on computer science and learn the fundamentals. 
        
As I went through university and studied computer science, my education never seemed to connect the dots between the technical world and the effects it had in the real world. The messaging was always the same, learn the fundamentals and have a great understanding of data structures and algorithms, so that one can have the skills to work at FANG, or even better, start your own company. As a student that did not come from a wealthly background, the pressure to conform to the norm was certaintly there. 

Like many of the students at my school, I had a offer before I graduated. It wasn't a traditional tech company, but I felt that my employor would have enough flexibility to hone my skills. It also had a rotational program in which I could learn about different aspects of the buisness. 

My first rotation was in programming self-checkout registers. This was a fun team, where I learned about machine learning, learned how to program registers, and I had a real impact on everyday customers. 

My second rotation was as working as a SOC analyst in the incident response team. Unlike the other teams, this was not a programming role and more of analyst role. This is where I was able to see real time attacks from nation states in real time.  -->
