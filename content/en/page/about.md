I am currently working as a security analyst. Currently focused on securing container technologies such as Docker and K8. In the past, I have created applications in Python, PHP, JavaScript, and Java. 

I am passionate about getting under-represented minorites to thrive in the STEM field. For those in K-12 and are in Atlanta, please check out [Johnson STEM Activity Center](https://www.johnsonstem.org) to see how you can be involved in STEM activities. 


I also try to help others, particularly, under-represented minorites, to get started in cybersecurity. Please reach out Twitter.
