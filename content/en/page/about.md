I am currently working as a security analyst. I have experience in creating applications in Python, PHP, JavaScript, and Java. 

I am passionate about getting under-represented minorites to thrive in the STEM field. For those in K-12 and are in Atlanta, please check out Johnson STEM Activity Center to see how you can be involved in STEM activities.
