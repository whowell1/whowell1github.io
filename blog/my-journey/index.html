<p>I have been in the tech field for almost two years and a common question that I get asked from college students and high school students of color is how did you get there? So to all that ask, here is my story.</p>
<p>If you had asked me when I was in high school that I would be in the tech field, I would not have believed you. Back then, I did not even know that was a career option. I vividly remember telling my teachers that I was unsure I was going to study, but that I was learning towards double majoring in biology and African American history. I tried to convince myself to major in biology because I enjoyed it in high school, and I wanted to major in African American history because I loved studying the Civil Rights Movement.</p>
<p>Unlike many of my peers, I took a semester off before I started to go to college as I navigated the move back to the States after going to high school overseas. It was during my gap year, I became interested in the documents that Ed Snowden showed the public about the capacity of the United States to spy on everyone in the world. I took an immediate interest in this because I knew from history that once the infrastructure to spy on people is in place, it is used against marginalized communities disproportionately.</p>
<p>The more I learned about Ed Snowden&rsquo;s revelations, the more questions I had. Questions about the devices that I used in my everyday life, and the power it had over me. Questions the relationship that I had with technology and how it leaves an impact on a social, economical, and political scale. However, as a history nerd, I did not have the language or the skills to understand the technical world that I lived in, so I decided to focus my studies on computer science and learn the fundamentals.</p>
<p>As I went through university and studied the language of computers, my education never seemed to connect the dots between the technical world and the political and social effects it had in the real world. The messaging was always the same, learn the fundamentals, have a great understanding of data structures and algorithms, so that you can have the skills to work at FANG company, or even better, start your own company.</p>
<p>Like many of the students at my school and in my bubble, I had an offer before I graduated. The company I would work for was in retail, but I felt that it was the perfect place to get my feet wet in the world of tech because it had a rotational program where I could learn different aspects of the business.</p>
<p>My first rotation was in a team that programmed self-checkout registers. This was a fun team, where I learned about machine learning, learned how to program registers, and I had a real impact on everyday customers. I never would have thought that so much technology went into implementing registers.
My second rotation was working as a SOC analyst on the incident response team. This was the first time that I was able to connect the dots between the technical world and the political and social effects it had in the real world. I learned and saw first hand how technology was weaponized in real time and the impact it had on people.</p>
<p>My next team that I was able to work on was on the High Performance Computing team. This team had some of the smartest people in the industry working on how to solve complex problems in stream computing and edge computing. I am really glad that I was able to work with seasoned engineers who were the best in their field because I became a better programmer working with them. However, despite the interesting work that I worked on, I missed working in security, so when I had an opportunity to go back, I could not say no.</p>
<p>After a long journey of hopping around different areas in technology, I feel like I have finally found something that aligns with my mission statement. Cyber security is definitely a field that excites me the most and I hope to be in this field a long time.</p>
