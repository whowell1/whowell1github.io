For the next six months, I want to learn how to be proficient in Kubernetes. My old team was in the process of adopting Kubernetes, but I wasn’t part of that project, so I missed the opportunity to learn it.</description>

      <description>It is a new year with a competitive job market and plenty of people looking for new roles. Recently, I was in a Twitter space where participants and I talked about red flags to look for when joining a new team. The following are a few we identified when looking for a new team.

      <description>I have been in the tech field for almost two years, and a common question that I get asked from college students and high school students that look like me is, “How did you get there?” So to all that ask, here is my story.
